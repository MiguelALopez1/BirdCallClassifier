# Bird Call Classifier Repo For Puerto Rico 2024 REU

## Objective:
We plan to create an Neural Network that will take in audio clips of different species of bird calls from Puerto Rican rain forest to classify them. T
his will be used to identify the biodiversity inorder to monitor endangered species. The initial code is heavily inspired by the [Audio Deep Learning Made Simple: Sound Classification, Step-by-Step](https://towardsdatascience.com/audio-deep-learning-made-simple-sound-classification-step-by-step-cebc936bbe5) aritcle. We are looking into the open source project [BirdNet](https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer). The dataset we are doing initial test on is [Bird songs from Europe (xeno-canto)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/monogenea/birdsongs-from-europe/data). In order to use it please create a *BirdSongsEurope* directory and move the *mp3* directory and the *metadata.csv* into it.
